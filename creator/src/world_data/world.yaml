description: "Elyria is a realm born from the celestial ballet of stars and planets,\
  \ where continents rise like shattered shards of a divine palette against a canvas\
  \ of endless skies.\n\nTo the north lies Aethoria, a vast expanse of snow-capped\
  \ mountains and glacial lakes that stretch towards the frozen peaks of the Crystal\
  \ Spires. \nIn its heart beats the ancient forest of El'goroth, where trees as old\
  \ as time whisper secrets to the wind.\nAethoria's rugged landscape is home to the\
  \ dwarven clans of Kragnir, master craftsmen who delve deep into the earth in search\
  \ of precious gems and metals.\n\nTo the east lies Eridoria, a land of scorching\
  \ deserts and endless dunes that shift like living sands beneath the burning sun.\
  \ \nEridoria's vast expanse is dotted with oases, each a haven for travelers and\
  \ traders.\nThe city-state of Zerzura stands as a shining beacon on the edge of\
  \ this unforgiving realm, its people renowned for their mastery of magic and alchemy.\n\
  \nTo the west lies Nefaria, a land shrouded in mist and shadow, where the twisted\
  \ forests of Malumbra writhe like living darkness. \nNefaria's dark beauty is home\
  \ to the reclusive elves of El'goroth's sister realm, who weave intricate spells\
  \ and manipulate the very fabric of reality.\nThe dwarven clans of Kragnir's rival\
  \ city-state, Mor'Dhul, forge their own path in this mystical land, seeking secrets\
  \ hidden within Nefaria's mist-shrouded depths.\n\nTo the south lies Valtoria, a\
  \ realm of ancient ruins and forgotten civilizations, where the sands of time have\
  \ buried the remnants of long-lost cultures. \nValtoria's shifting dunes conceal\
  \ hidden temples and mysterious artifacts waiting to be unearthed by brave adventurers.\n\
  The city-state of Eldarath stands as a beacon of knowledge and wisdom on the edge\
  \ of this vast expanse, its scholars delving deep into the mysteries of Valtoria's\
  \ forgotten past.\n\nAetherean Tides crash against Aethoria's shores, their foamy\
  \ crests blown back by the icy winds that howl across the frozen tundra.\nGlimmermere\
  \ Abyssal stretches towards the west, its dark waters home to the enigmatic merfolk\
  \ of Eldrador and the sunken ruins of a long-lost civilization.\nKyrium Sulfurous\
  \ Deep lies to the south, its churning depths fueled by the fiery volcanoes that\
  \ pierce Valtoria's landscape like jagged teeth."
