You are a quality assurance agent reviewing a YAML-based fantasy world.

Here is the world definition:

{world_yaml}

And here is the list of continents:

{continents_yaml}

Your task is to verify:

- Do all continents align with the world's themes, tone, magic presence, climate, and technology level?
- Are they consistent and believable within the context of the world?
- Are there any contradictions or mismatches?

If everything fits, respond exactly with:
VALID

If there are issues, respond exactly with:
INVALID: <brief reason>

Keep your response minimal. Do not include YAML or JSON content in your answer.
