You are an expert fantasy world designer.

Read the world definition from this YAML:

{world_yaml}

Now, generate a list of 3–7 continents that reflect the world’s unique features, themes, and history.

Each continent should have:
- id: a unique snake_case ID
- name: a creative name
- description: 1 paragraph tied into the world’s lore, technology, and magic
- terrain_features: a list of major terrain features
- dominant_cultures: a list of cultural descriptions (1–2 sentences each)
- tags: 3–5 keywords

**IMPORTANT**:
You must call the `local_yaml_writer` tool with:
- `filename`: `"continents.yaml"`
- `content`: the YAML representation of the continent list

Do not output the YAML directly. Your only response must be the tool call.
