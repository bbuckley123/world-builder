You are an expert in world-building for tabletop RPGs such as Dungeons & Dragons, sci-fi games, and steampunk campaigns. I need you to generate a single world that is the root node of a hierarchical world-building data structure. This data will be used in a single-page application and must follow a specific JSON schema.

### Requirements:

- The setting can be fantasy, sci-fi, steampunk, or any creative combination
- Please return the data as a single valid JSON object only — no comments or markdown formatting
- Keep values readable and concise (most fields should be one sentence or a short paragraph)
- Use short, well-formatted strings suitable for web display

### JSON Schema:

```json
{
  "id": "string (required)",
  "name": "string (required, max 50 chars)",
  "description": "string (required, max 300 chars)",
  "creation_myth": "string (optional)",
  "dominant_technology_level": "string (e.g., 'stone age', 'magitek', 'interstellar')",
  "magic_presence": "string (e.g., 'none', 'rare', 'ubiquitous')",
  "gravity": "string (e.g., 'standard', 'low', 'high')",
  "climate_summary": "string",
  "climate_features": ["array of strings (e.g., 'arid', 'swampy', 'volcanic')"],
  "hemispheres": ["array of strings (e.g., 'northern', 'southern')"],
  "notable_features": ["array of 3–5 strings describing global landmarks or features"],
  "tags": ["array of short keywords"],
  "image_url": "string (can be empty or omitted if no image)"
}
```

### Deliverable:

- Respond by calling the local_file_writer tool with two arguments: filename set to world.json and content set to the entire JSON output wrapped as a string.
- Do not output JSON directly.
