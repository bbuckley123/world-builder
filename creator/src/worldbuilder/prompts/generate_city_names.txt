The cities _could_ be large, small, named after a landmark, may or may not have a preface such as city, village, hamlet, etc. Use your imagination. The role-playing genre for this world is {{ genre }}. The world is *not* Earth-like but should be extraordinary and imaginative. Please generate between 2 and 5 city names.
